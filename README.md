<b> History </b>
<p>
2019 & 2020 - There is only first puzzle solved, those were used to warm up before years 2021 and 2022. The plan is to continue with them when advent 2022 is over. </p>
<p> 2021 - First serious try, made 4 puzzles. </p>
<p> 2022 - Second serious try, the goal is to do as much as I manage during advent time. </p>
